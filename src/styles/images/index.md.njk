Avoid using images for unnecessary decoration. Only use images if there’s a real user need.

This guidance is for government teams that build online services. To learn how to use images in GOV.UK mainstream content, go to [GOV.UK content guidance for images](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/images).

## Using images to give information

Services usually work best without relying on images. Focus on writing clear, simple content for your service first.

Adding images can sometimes help users better understand instructions. However, images should only be visual aids — written content must contain all the information the user needs to complete the service.

If you choose to add an image to your service, you’ll need to carefully decide if the image needs to be described with alternative text (alt text).

### Alt text

Alternative text, or alt text, is read out by screen readers or displayed onscreen — usually when images do not load or have been disabled in browser settings.

All images should include the alt attribute, even if it’s left empty without alt text (`alt=""`).

#### When to use alt text

Only add alt text when you need to describe visual details you cannot practically include in the written content.

There are some cases when an empty `alt=""` attribute is more appropriate. These include:

- a decorative image that does not include important content
- an icon with a text label, where the alt text would repeat the text label
- an image used in a link, where the image is not needed to understand the link

To decide if an image needs alt text, see the [Web Accessibility Initiative alt decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/).

#### Writing good alt text

Good alt text:

- tells people what information the image provides
- describes the content and function of the image
- is specific, meaningful and concise

Use normal punctuation, like commas and full stops, so the text is easy to read and understand.

Generally, aim for no more than 2 sentences of alt text.

Do not write alt text that:

- includes the name of the photographer or person who created the image
- starts with ‘Image of’, ‘Graphic of’ or ‘Photo of’
- repeats information from the page
- includes extra information not in the image

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "alt-text", html: true, open: true, size: "l"}) }}

### Avoid images that contain text

Text becomes unreadable when the user zooms into images, especially PNGs and JPGs. If the image does contain text, use SVG because it remains readable when the user zooms in. The alt text should be the same as the text displayed in the image.

## Aspect ratio

### Photography

The aspect ratio for photographs should be 3:2.

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "default", html: false, open: false, size: "l"}) }}


### Illustrations or representative imagery

If your image represents something physical, such as a letter, document or credit card, you should use the aspect ratio of that item.

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "representative", html: false, open: false, size: "l"}) }}
